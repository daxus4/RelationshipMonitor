# RelationshipMonitor

Since the creation of the first social networks, these platforms gained more and more users during the years. Today social networks are used by more attracted more than half a billion users that scroll their homepages several times during the day [9]. Due to this colossal number of users, social networks require data structures that can store all information in a reasonable memory space and scalable algorithms that can query the data promptly.

In this project I developed, in C, both data structures and algorithms to manage a network of multiple-type relationships between entities. Using nested red-black trees, it has been possible to reduce the time and space complexity of algorithms which manages the entities and the relationships between them.
